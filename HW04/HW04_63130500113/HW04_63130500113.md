3. Find average median and standard deviation of rating book

```{R}
AnalyRating <- ProgBook %>% select(Rating) %>% summarise(Average=mean(Rating),Median=median(Rating),SD=sd(Rating))
AnalyRating
```

result from output:

```{R}
#    Average Median        SD
# 1 4.067417    4.1 0.2907487

# the summary show rating of book has average is 4.06 points, median is 4.1 points and standard deviation is 0.29 points recursively.
```

4. find average median and standard deviation of price book

```{R}
AnalyPrice <- ProgBook %>% select(Price) %>% summarise(Average=mean(Price),Median=median(Price),SD=sd(Price))
AnalyPrice
```

result from output:

```{R}
#    Average   Median       SD
# 1 54.54186 46.31765 35.71148

# the summary show price of book has average is 54.54 USD, median is 46.31 USD and standard deviation is 35.71 USD recursively.
```

5. find count in each type book.

```{R}
TypeBook <- ProgBook %>% count(Type) %>% summarise(TypeBook=Type,count=n) 
TypeBook
```

result from output:

```{R}
# show book count in each type of book
#          TypeBook count
# 1           ebook     7
# 2       Hardcover    96

## Find insight of data visualization

### Scatter plot

### Uncurtainly scatter plot
Compare number of page and price by show each type of book are different and predict it is possible? if book have more page, price of book is increase.
```{R}
# plot scatter with uncurtainly point
UncurtainlyRatingReview <- ProgBook %>% ggplot(aes(x=Price,y=Number_Of_Pages)) + geom_point(aes(color=Type)) + geom_smooth()

# show uncurtainly scatter plot
UncurtainlyRatingReview + ggtitle("Compare and predict page of book with price by type of book") + xlab("Price") + ylab("")
```

result from output:

**Describe:** The scatter plot compare between number of pages and price. if book have more  number of pages, price of book will be increased.

### Box plot
show rating in each type book.
```{R}
# plot box
BoxRating <- ProgBook %>% ggplot(aes(x=Type,y=Rating)) + geom_boxplot(aes(color=Type)) + geom_dotplot(aes(color=Type),binaxis='y', stackdir='center', dotsize=0.3)

# show box plot
BoxRating + ggtitle("Rating by type of book in box plot") + xlab("") + ylab("Rating")
```

result from output:

**Describe:** Box plot show rating book in each type of book has outliner value and all data of book rating with color point are seperate by type of book. by peperbooks have the most data and ebooks have the most rating.
